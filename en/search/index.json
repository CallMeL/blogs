[{"content":"Generally speaking, the beginning of 2024 has been very busy and fulfilling. Apart from not exercising at all and not reading a word book, it is all as expected. I thought that I would be able to get active in the New Year and start reading, but I found an excuse to postpone it until after the exam. \u0026hellip;\nWhat happened Go to work: Got my first job to work in a nice office with nice colleagues and really enjoying what I\u0026rsquo;m working on. Once proved with experience that the industry is a better place for me than the academic. As I feel like I\u0026rsquo;m actually contributing to something tangible and the time is totally worth it with the feedback and fulfillment (and of course the money) Got a 4.0：Just after sighing that the study environment in Germany gives people a sense of comfort when they can fail and start over again, I received the first hang-up in my life. Because I failed to meet the word count requirement for a peer review assignment in one seminar, the doctoral student who taught this course stammered and told me, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry, we can\u0026rsquo;t let you pass, it\u0026rsquo;s not fair to the others\u0026rdquo;. The theory of hindsight did reveal that they had an annotated minimum word count, which I should have glanced at when I was writing the assignment, but my brain didn\u0026rsquo;t process the word minimal at all\u0026hellip; Sort of a not-so-serious lesson. However, I have also reflected on my attitude towards seminar, because there is only a distinction between passing and failing, so it\u0026rsquo;s all about eating the old money and not being very committed to doing it, and now a lot of the opportunities are from previous undergraduates doing the coursework based on their interest and enthusiasm to help me fight for it, so I\u0026rsquo;d better be serious about doing seminar next semester.\nA lot of presentations：At the end of January, I intensively conducted three seminar presentations, and made almost 50 pages of PowerPoint. although I still need notes to help me, but it\u0026rsquo;s not like the first presentation in December when I just read from the notes, I\u0026rsquo;m getting more and more comfortable of using English. It\u0026rsquo;s true that the more I put my heart into the project, the more I\u0026rsquo;m able to report it, for example, the best one is the one that I did all by myself.\nGot two 1.0：I got perfect scores on the first two ORAL exams and was very happy. However, at first I felt that it was a bit unreal, and I even thought that I would be told later that I was wrongly evaluated and that I would have to take back my grades. After all, the teacher of one of the courses said just before the exam that it was almost impossible to get a 1.0, but he was very happy to congratulate me on getting a perfect score that day. For a moment, I wondered if he had lowered his standards because I was an Asian woman. But that\u0026rsquo;s just a bad habit of doubting yourself before something good happens, and in the end, of course, I accepted the result with confidence.\n\u0026ldquo;Confidence is the realization of one\u0026rsquo;s own promises to oneself,\u0026rdquo; and after looking back at my schedule, I think it\u0026rsquo;s a good thing that I was able to prepare for all three exams at the same time and get at least seven and a half hours of sleep every day, even though I had about 20 hours a week to devote to my job. Quite proud of myself.\nCooking：I tried to make fried chicken, thanks to the cheap and large amount of solid oil in the supermarket, I unlocked fried food. I also unlocked sandwich making, which is better and cheaper than Mensa food. I don\u0026rsquo;t have to have awkward small talk with my classmates in the cafeteria. before, I would alternate one day of pasta and one day of rice, but the frequency of pasta has increased significantly in the past few weeks, because of its convenience and hassle-free nature. I don\u0026rsquo;t cook a lot of stir-fry dishes, but I mainly make a stew with roasted vegetables, and udon noodles go with everything. On New Year\u0026rsquo;s Eve, I used the gyoza skins I bought to make gyoza that I could eat for two weeks, and the best place for chives is in the gyoza. Plan Ahead There are still a few exams to go, but there will still be plenty of free time. The more vague plan is to continue sketching, as well as going to the gym twice a week, being able to read immersively, and swiping through fewer running videos. German will still have to be learned, even though the A1.1 exams are sparse.\n","date":"2024-02-08T22:11:29+01:00","image":"https://blog.hannahlin.me/zh-cn/p/2024-01/cover_hu10527056679921326757.jpeg","permalink":"https://blog.hannahlin.me/en/p/2024-01/","title":"Random Summary 01"}]
